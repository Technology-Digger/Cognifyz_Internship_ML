## Tasks Included

### Task 4: Location-Based Analysis (Completed)

This task focuses on performing a geographical analysis of restaurant data to understand how location influences restaurant distribution and characteristics. The analysis includes:

- City-wise restaurant concentration  
- Average restaurant ratings across cities  
- Price range distribution by location  
- Latitude and longitude-based geographical visualization  

The objective of this task is to derive meaningful insights from location-based data.

### Task 1 and Task 2

The remaining selected tasks will be added to the repository as the internship progresses and will be documented within their respective folders.
