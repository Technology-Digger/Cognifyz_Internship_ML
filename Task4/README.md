# Task 4: Location-Based Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this task is to perform a geographical analysis of restaurant data
to understand how location influences restaurant distribution, pricing, and ratings.
This task focuses on extracting meaningful insights from spatial and location-based
information.

---

## Task Description
In this task, restaurant data is analyzed using location-related features such as
city, latitude, and longitude. The analysis aims to identify patterns in restaurant
concentration across different cities and to examine how ratings and price ranges
vary by location.

---

## Approach
The following steps were followed to complete this task:

1. Loaded and explored the dataset to understand its structure and features.
2. Cleaned and prepared location-related columns such as city and geographical
   coordinates.
3. Analyzed city-wise restaurant concentration to identify areas with higher
   restaurant density.
4. Calculated and visualized average restaurant ratings across cities.
5. Analyzed average price ranges by city to observe pricing patterns.
6. Visualized the geographical distribution of restaurants using latitude and
   longitude scatter plots.
7. Interpreted the results and summarized key location-based insights.

## Visualizations Included
- City-wise restaurant count
- Average restaurant ratings by city
- Average price range by city
- Latitude and longitude-based geographical distribution plot

---

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Key Insights
- Restaurant distribution is highly concentrated in a few major cities, indicating
  higher competition and business density in urban areas.
- Cities with a large number of restaurants do not always show the highest average
  ratings, suggesting variations in quality and customer experience.
- Pricing patterns differ across cities, reflecting regional economic differences
  and market positioning.
- The geographical distribution highlights clear clustering of restaurants in
  urban regions.

## Conclusion
This task demonstrates how location-based analysis can provide valuable insights
into restaurant distribution and characteristics. By leveraging geographical and
city-level data, meaningful patterns related to ratings, pricing, and concentration
can be identified.
